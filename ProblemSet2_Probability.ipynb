What is the probability that the two picked the same coin?\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a coin, not necessarily a fair one, but with $P(H) \\neq$ 0 and $P(H) \\neq$ 1 (that is, you can get both heads and tails by flipping it). Of the following statements, which ones are true if we flip the coin many times?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability of every sequence becomes small.\n",
    "2. The probability of every number of heads becomes small.\n",
    "3. The probability of every proportion of heads becomes small.\n",
    "4. The probability of every range of proportions becomes small.\n",
    "5. The probability of some ranges of proportions becomes small.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: all of the above, except #4, are true.** Number 1 is true because every time you flip a coin, you double the number of sequences - you keep adding more and more possibilities, so the probability of any one particular sequence tends to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number 2 must be true as well: even if the probability of obtaining heads is very low, if it's nonzero then we'll eventually accumulate many heads, getting further and further away from the number we expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number 3 is true because every proportion of heads corresponds to a given exact number of heads in the sequence. Keeping the ratio between the number of heads and the total number of flips may even be impossible; for example, if we expect $H/T$ = 0.5, this ratio will **never** be exactly attained if we have an odd number of flips. It may be *very close* to 0.5 if we have, say, 556 heads and 557 tails, in which case $H/T$ = 0.49551$\\dots$, but it certainly isn't equal to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One quick way to see that number 4 cannot be true is to realise that if we consider the entire range of possible proportions (from 0 to 1), the probability of that range is 1, constant. And to see that number 5 is true, consider the probability that the proportion of heads stays below 10% if the coin is fair."
